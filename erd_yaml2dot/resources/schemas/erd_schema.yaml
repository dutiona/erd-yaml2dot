$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"

# This schema does not validate:
#  - in entities:
#    - that the fields in primary-key is properly declared (in fields)
#    - fields name are unique
#   - a weak entity is required to be in a relationship with a non-weak (strong) entity.
#  - in relationships:
#    - that the entities referenced in relationships exists in entities
#    - that the additional fields are unique
# This is not possible with a schema.
# All those constraints are checked in Python instead.
