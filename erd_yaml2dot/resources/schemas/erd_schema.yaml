# This schema does not validate:
#  - in entities:
#    - that the fields in primary-key is properly declared (in fields)
#    - fields name are unique
#  - in relationships:
#    - that the entities referenced in relationships exists in entities
#    - that the additional fields are unique
# This is not possible with a schema.
# All those constraints are checked in Python instead.
